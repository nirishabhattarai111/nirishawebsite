     <h2>Background of Holi, Nepal Water Festival</h2>
     <p>The origin of Holi Festival can be traced back to the "Mahabharata", Indian famous epic. According to the legend, King Hiranyakashipu was so arrogant and didn't allow people to worship Lord Vishnu. However, Prince Prahlada was an ardent devotee of Vishnu and openly opposed his father. This enraged Hiranyakashipu. Since then, the king ordered his sister Holika to burn the prince on the full moon night. Under the blessing of God Vishnu, Prahlada was unscathed while Holika was burned into ashes. When the prince walked out of the fire, people sprinkled him with colorful water to express the praise of goodness and hatred of evil.</p>
