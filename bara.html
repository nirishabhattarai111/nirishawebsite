                <p>Lentil Pancake {Newari Bara, Wo:} is a famous dish often enjoyed as an appetizer or a snack in Nepal. It is made with one star ingredient - lentil, which makes them naturally-gluten-free and vegan. 
Savory pancakes are a thing in Nepal and let me introduce you to everyone’s favorite : Lentil Pancake {Nepali Bara or Wo:) These savory lentil pancakes are made with just one main ingredient  - lentils (split black lentils and/or a combination of split black lentils and split moong lentils).  The recipe I am sharing today is a very basic one although you can jazz things up with eggs, meat, or veggies of your choice.  Lentils are a staple in my pantry for many reasons and I am happy to add a new lentil-based recipe to my repertoire as it can be enjoyed as a quick meal or an appetizer.  Lentil Pancake {Newari Bara, Wo:} is made with split black lentils with skin on, however I had split black lentils without the skin in my pantry so I used that kind. If you use split black lentils with skin, make sure to separate the skin and discard it otherwise, your final pancake won’t turn out correctly. Like most dried-lentils and beans, split black lentils needs to be soaked 8-12 hours prior to making the pancakes so, please plan accordingly. The recipe in itself is fairly simple but here are few things to keep in mind : <br>

1) Rinse and pick lentils  for any dirt and pebbles. if using split black lentils with skin on, rinse them few times after soaking, which will naturally release the skin. Continue to rinse and separate the skin prior to blending. To avoid the hassle of separating the skin, use black split lentil without the skin (it’s pale yellowish in color). <br>

2) Lentils needs to be pureed to a smooth, somewhat pourable consistency but not liquified. Do not add a lot of water when blending, however you may need to add 2-3 tablespoon at a time to get your blender going. I pureed lentils in 2 separate batches but that will vary on the amount of lentils and the size of your blender.<br> 

3) Use a non-stick pan or cast-iron skillet when cooking lentil pancakes {Newari Bara, Wo:}.<br><br>

Lentil Pancake {Newari Bara, Wo:} can be enjoyed by itself but it is typically enjoyed as on a platter with other dish such as tomato achar, fried eggs, different curries, flat beaten rice (chuira) etc. Nepali Bara, Wo: holds a special significance among Newari people (traditional inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley with a rich cultural heritage) as it is given as a part of good-luck food called “sagun” during festivals, birthdays, celebrations etc. To Watch Full Recipe Click Too <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvVOzWSK0dI">BARA Recipe</a>
