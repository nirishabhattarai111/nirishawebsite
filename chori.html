        <h2> CHORI BIBAHA(Marriage by kidnapping)</h2>
        <p>Chori Bibaha is a traditional marriage ritual observed in the Tamang communities. This ritual usually occurs when the bride may not consent easily or if a boy wants to avoid long procedures of an arranged marriage. A girl is usually captured from a fair or a market by a boy. After capture, if the girl persistently refuses to get married for three days then she is allowed to return to her parents. If she consents, a proper wedding ceremony is organized. In recent times, this ritual is rarely observed as modernization and laws against kidnapping are enforced.</p>
