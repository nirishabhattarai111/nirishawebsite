    <h2>Bhai Tika (Day 5)</h2>
    The fifth and last day of Tihar is called Bhai Tika. On this day sisters apply "tilaka" or "tika" on the foreheads of their brothers. This is done to ensure the long life of their bothers and thank them for the protection they provide. It is believed that, Yamaraj, the God of Death, visited his sister Goddess Yamuna's house. He stayed there for five days so Tihar is also called Yamapanchak. He was pleased with the Hospitality so he asked her to make a wish. Yamuna wished that the love and faith of the brothers and sisters who meet every year on the same day remain strong and the brothers have a long life and fame. Yamaraj granted the wish.In Bhai Tika, brothers sit on the floor while their sisters perform their puja. During the puja sisters circle brothers by dropping oil on the floor from a copper pitcher. They also applying oil to their brother's hair. After that, they apply seven-color tikas on the brother's forehead. Similarly, brothers also give tikas to their sisters. They also exchange gifts. This ritual is practiced for both younger and elder brothers.Those without a sister or brother join relatives or friends for tika.This festival makes the relationship between brothers and sisters stronger.Along with the seven-coloured tika, sisters provide brothers with Sagun, sweets, Makhamali (Gomphrena globosa) garland.[17] They also provide a sacred cotton thread of Tantric importance. The thread is similar to Janai and is meant to protect their bodies.
